# dotfiles

I always get mad when i change some configurations of mine in one computer, and forget to upload again the file to github, so i have done this repository

# how it works?

Just `clone` this at the HOME directory of your linux and after that run:

`chmod +x install.sh`
`./install.sh`
* Disclaimer:  always read first other's `.sh` files

And than the commands will save your actual `.vimrc` and `tmux.conf` files and send those to the `dotfiles_backup` folder, to be recovered if needed

# NOTES

If you dont like my config, you can make your own or make your own fork, there are many useful things here
